## Who am I?
Hello, my name is Anton Koetzler-Faust. Currently, I'm a university student majoring in computer science. I've been avidly self-teaching since my enrollment however.
## What am I interested in & what have I been doing
I was very interested in creating GUIs, and thus I learned wxWidgets a while back. Now, I'm expanding my knowledge on web design. I've been trying to create a social media website with XAMPP, HTML/CSS/JS, and PHP. Thus, I can conclude that my interest stems in web design and GUI development.
